# Data-Science-AI
  The notebook is trying to analyze credit card fraud and how to detect it using features like the distance from home where the transaction happened, The distance from the last transaction, Ratio of purchased price transaction to median purchase price, Is the transaction from the same retailer,	Is the transaction through chip,	Is the transaction done using a pin number and Is the transaction an online order.
  It was very helpful learning how AI can assist with programming and can help when unsure how to do something much more efficiently than researching and looking through documentation. But it also can overcomplicate things. This is a problem I ran into and had to check for correctness because it would give code that had a lot of unnecessary stuff added that would not add value. Another example where I had to verify was when the column names would be wrong. I usually knew to do this because I would get an error. 
  A potential danger of someone using AI without learning data science properly is that if a problem arises they will not know how to solve it because they will not know what the codes actually doing.
